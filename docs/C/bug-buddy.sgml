  <title>Introduction</title> 

  <para>
    The <application>bug-buddy</application> program is a tool which
    will guide you through making a bug report as painlessly as possible.
    You can alter things at any stage, and then either send, save, or
    abandon the resulting report. This document describes
    version &version; of <application>bug-buddy</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
    <application>bug-buddy</application> can be started in a variety
    of ways:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Open the <guimenu>main GNOME menu</guimenu> and select
      <menuchoice>
       <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
       <guisubmenu>Utilities</guisubmenu>
       <guimenuitem>Bug Report Tool</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      Run <command>bug-buddy</command> at the prompt in a terminal such
      as <application>gnome-terminal</application> or
      <application>xterm</application>
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      If you are using the <application>GNOME file manager</application>,
      gmc, you can double-click your mouse on a core file to start it
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      When a GNOME program experiences a bad crash, a <guilabel>crash
      dialogue box</guilabel> is displayed. If <application>bug-buddy</application>
      is present on the system, then one of the options in the dialogue
      box will be to submit a bug report. Selecting that will invoke 
     <application>bug-buddy</application>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
    <application>bug-buddy</application> is a very structured program.
    At any stage you can continue forward or head backwards to correct
    earlier details.
  </para>

  <para>
    The aim of all this is to be able to collect all the information
    which a developer will need to reproduce the same problem and be
    able to fix it. Some of the information generated may look a bit
    off-putting, but don't delete it. It will be useful.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="contact-info">
  <title>Contact information</title>

  <para>
    <application>bug-buddy</application> first asks for these pieces
    of information, in order to be able to send the report correctly.
    It makes very good guesses so you should be able to skip straight
    ahead.
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Your name</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       GNOME works this out itself, but you can change it if you care to
       here.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Email address</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       Again, GNOME should work this out. You should not need to change
       this unless you normally fetch your mail from another account. In
       that case, you may wish to put your other account here, so that
       any responses to the bug go to that address.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Full path of sendmail</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       This allows you to check that bug-buddy is looking in the right
       place when it tries to send email. You will almost certainly not
       need to change this. 
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Bug tracking system</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       <application>bug-buddy</application> can send reports to several
       different places. A drop-down list is available here. Currently
       you can report bugs to the bug-trackers of KDE, GNOME, and Debian
       GNU/Linux.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>
    There is an <guibutton>About</guibutton> button in the lower corner,
    which provides access to an About box and to
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bug-buddy.org/">
    bug-buddy's home on the web</ulink>. 
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="system-config">
  <title>System Configuration</title>

  <para>
    There are certain details which bug-fixers always want to know about
    your system. <application>bug-buddy</application> goes and looks for
    the details on your machine. If you happen to be using something which 
    you know is different, you can alter the details here. You shouldn't
    need to.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you don't want to see this every time you use the program, you can
    select the <guibutton>automatically go to next page when complete</guibutton>
    option. If you do this and later want to go back and check, you can use
    the <guibutton>Back</guibutton> option from the <link
    linkend="report-info">Reporting Information</link> section to get back
    here.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="report-info">
  <title>Report Information</title>

  <para>
    The options which show up here vary according to which of the
    radio-button choices you make. Sometimes it is much more helpful
    to add information to an existing report than to start a new one.
    (And sometimes you realise you forgot something in one of your
    earlier reports, and you want to add it. You can search the bug 
    trackers for 
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bugs.gnome.org">GNOME</ulink>,
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bugs.kde.org">KDE</ulink> or
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bugs.debian.org">Debian</ulink> to
    find a relevant bug report and note down the number. If you then
    select <guibutton>Add information to an existing bug report</guibutton>,
    you will be prompted for the bug number to add to. 
  </para>
  <para>
    If you select <guibutton>File a new bug report</guibutton> then you
    will be prompted for the package number, the package version, the
    bug severity and the class of bug:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Package</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       You can search through the drop-down list for the correct package
       to assign this bug to. If you know the exact filename of the program
       you ran, and you use rpms, you can use the command <command>rpm -qf 
       <filename>/full/path/to/file</filename></command> to verify which
       package it came from. If you use Debian, you can use the command 
       <command>dpkg -S <filename>/full/path/to/file</filename></command>.
       To find out the full pathname to, say, gnome-terminal, or
       kfloppy, you can use the command <command>which</command>: 
       <command>which gnome-terminal</command> or <command>which 
       kfloppy</command>. 
     </para>
     <para>
       If you are still not sure which package to assign a bug to, searching
       the bug-trackers on the web by keyword to find out where other
       people have assigned it in the past can be very helpful.
     </para>
     <para>
       Because there are so many possible packages, the drop-down list is
       split alphabetically. Clicking on a package beginning with 'a',
       for example, will give you a further selection of several other 
       apps beginning with 'a'. So you will need to double-click on a
       package and then look at the sub-categories to find some packages.
     </para>
     <para>
       If you do not select a package, it will be left as 'general'. This
       will get through to the bug-tracking system, but someone there will
       have to manually assign it a package, which slows its progress 
       down. Some bug-trackers send back automatic "Please assign a 
       package next time" responses to bugs with no package, too.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Version</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       Once you have decided on a package, checking its version number
       is much simpler. For GNOME and KDE programs, it will often be in
       the 'About' box of a program.
     </para>
     <para>
       FIXME: need more about getting package version number. Debian, etc?
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Severity</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       There are different severities of bugs you can assign. If you 
       are not sure, normal is fine. There should not be that many 
       critical or grave bugs in software which is in daily use. They
       tend to get fixed fast. So it is probably unlike you will need
       those two categories. Before assigning bugs to those, you really
       should get the latest stable version and check it has not already
       been fixed.
     </para>

     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Critical</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          This bug makes unrelated software on the system (or the whole 
          system) break, or causes serious data loss, or introduces a 
          security hole on systems where you install the software. Examples
          would be hanging the entire machine or overwriting files it should
          not even touch. 
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Grave</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          This bug makes the software in question unusable or mostly so, 
          or causes data loss, or introduces a security hole allowing 
          access to the accounts of users who use the software. A program
          which consistently crashes on startup or produces files called
          <filename>core</filename> in your home directory might well be 
          grave. 
        </para>

       <term>Wishlist</term>

        <para>
          This is a useful category for two things: very hard to fix
          bugs; and requests for features or enhancements. ("It would be

    <term>Class</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       The default class of a bug is a software bug: "there is something
       wrong with the program". Sometimes this is not quite what you need.
       You can change the class to a few other things. A "documentation 
       bug" is obvious. "Change request" and "support" are not. FIXME!!

 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="description">
  <title>Description</title>
  <para>
    The <guilabel>Short subject for the bug report</guilabel> section
    will be used at the start of the emailed bug report. You do not
    need the package name in it as you have already assigned that. But
    being specific is good. "Crash when I try to save" or "Forgets my
    preferences" is much better than "Bug". Hackers will read these
    summaries when looking for something they can fix, and clear 
    one-sentence summaries will catch their attention. 
  </para>

  <para>
    The <guilabel>Full description of the bug</guilabel> section is where
    you describe what you did, what happened, and what you expected to
    happen. Good things to include:
  </para>
   
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Exact copies of any error messages;
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Your window manager name and version (especially if the bug involves 
      moving things around the screen or mouse focus problems);
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      If you can make it happen in one way, and not in another way,
      include that. If there are two ways to do something (a menu
      selection and a typed command, for example), and only one triggers
      the bug, definitely include that;
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Why you think it is a bug. What should have happened instead?
      Whilst this is obvious for some things, ("It shouldn't crash when
      I try to save the file") it is not obvious for others. "If it
      can't save the file, it should tell me so that I don't keep editing
      it without realising I am wasting my effort". 
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Sometimes screenshots can be helpful. Please do not send one in
      a bug-buddy report! But if you have one, mention that you have it,
      so that a bug-fixer who would like to see it can email you about it.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
    If you have any suggestions on what caused it or how to fix it,
    wonderful. If not, don't worry. Just explain what happened. If
    a developer needs more information, s/he can mail you back for
    it. 
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="more-info">
  <title>More information</title>

  <para>
    You may want to add more information. If your description of how you
    caused the bug was sufficiently detailed, you may not want to fill
    this in. Deciding what belongs here and what belongs in the previous
    section can be tricky. 
  </para>

  <para>
    If you have a (short!) text-file which contains information of use
    you can include it here, too. If you have a small HTML file which
    crashes your editor, or two sets of options for a program where one
    works and the other doesn't, these are the sort of things to include
    here. 
  </para>
 </sect1>

       file manager, select this. Also select this if you have a core file
       which you know was created as a result of the bug you are reporting.
       An extra box will appear where you can tell it where the core file
       lives.

 <sect1 id="collect-debug-info">
  <title>Collecting debugging information</title>
  <para>
    This page may look completely strange. You will see it if you have
    selected "Attach to a crashed application" or "Read from a core file"
    in the previous page. When the application crashed, a copy of all the
    details of what the program was doing was frozen. This was either dumped
    to the core file or held in place. What <application>bug-buddy</application>
    is doing is to go through all that information and find out what steps
    the program took to get to the stage where it crashed. Programmers
    can follow the rather cryptic output and work out where something
    started to go wrong. This output will be automatically attached to 
    your bug report.
  </para>
  <para>
    Sometimes <application>bug-buddy</application> will not be able to
    generate the information and tell you that it cannot recognise the
    core file. If so, simply continue to the next stage. Do not send the
    core file itself as an alternative. It is only the output that 
    bug-buddy wants.

    Once you have finished your report, you can decide what to do with
    it. You will probably want to submit it to the bug-tracking system,
    but if you want to send it to yourself for some reason, you can. 
    You can also choose to save the report so far to a file. If you
